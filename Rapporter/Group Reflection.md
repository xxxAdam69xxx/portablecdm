# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 1

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

In this stage we haven't been introduced to the project. We wish to be able to clearly define the scope of the application, including priority of features and definition of the user we are creating value for. The first step in order to do this would be to attend the introduction lecture on wednesday next week. Here we will gain useful insights in the upcoming project, as well as a scope of the application to be created. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

This week we wrote our social contract. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic. 

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. Our success criteria will be based on the project specification, thus this is a part of our weekly reflection that will be further explained in the upcoming weeks.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project and don’t know what acceptance tests are. We would like to know what acceptance tests are. We will do this by googling, reading course literature and attending lectures.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project yet. The design is an important aspect, meaning we will put a lot of time to achieve a design with high standard.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we know more about the project we will be able to set up some specifications, therefore we want to know more. To do this we will participate at the lecture about the project in order to get to know the assignment. 

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we have a good grasp on the project we will make detailed class diagrams. We will to this by drawing on knowledge from previous courses.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we know more about the assignment we can break it down in order to plan the project. So, we will wait for the project introduction and go from there.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. This means that it will be hard to determine which KPI’s that will be appropriate. Our goal is to determine three reasonable KPI’s that will probably change during the weeks. To get there we need to learn about the project and literature to be able to determine the KPI’s.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project and we are not familiar with Findbugs or any similar tool. As such, at least our code doesn’t contain any bugs, wihoo! Our goal is to get to know these tools and learn how to use them. To do this we will browse what alternatives there are and be all ears during the lectures.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Since the project has not started yet it is hard to distribute roles within the group. Having eight people working on the same project we would save a lot of time and increase efficiency if we distribute clear roles. Our objective is to distribute clear roles. 

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

This week we’ve been introduced to scrum as a technique. For the coming weeks we wish to get to know other practices which are appropriate to use. Hopefully the coming lectures and exercises will give some insight as to where we are heading. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

We’ve spent 15 hours on the course during this week. Our goal is to put in 20 hours a week with some flexibility from week to week. To achieve this we are going to create an excel document where we can put down our hours worked each day. Also, when we get to know the project it will be easier to schedule our time. 

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

During the Lego exercise we realized the importance of sprint reviews. Although we assume that the sprint reviews during the actual project will be of a different character The sprint review was important in order to adjust the work tempo.

**Test practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Version control - Git
Scrum - Github
We would like to adopt the industry standards, and we will do it by researching on google and through course literature.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We haven’t yet had any guest lectures or literature reviews. In the future we would like to be able to relate them to our work. We will do this by attending the lectures.



# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 2

The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
As of now, we don’t have a fully clarified scope of the application yet. However, what we do have is a specified client that we will work together with. In our case, the client functions as a terminal. In other words, our client is responsible for handling vessels both departing and arriving. Today, we don’t have a contact person assigned and therefore we have not made a priority of features, as we are not aware of the prefered values and features that the client is expecting from the application. In the introduction to the project, we were told to create a user story on our own. This, we will finish after Easter, when we have processed the project and its scope a bit more, thus being more full-fledged when creating the user story.

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Last week we wrote our social contract. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic, as stated in our contract. 
As of this week, we have not yet encountered any difficulties regarding the group dynamics etc. Therefore, the social contract remains the same as last week’s. However, if the group starts to perform worse when the actual project and coding begins, we will be inclined to change and develop the contract with that in mind. Thus, it is something to keep in mind, that if the circumstances alters and the social contract needs to be furthered developed, the social contract is a tool to improve the dynamics of the group. Also, the social contract will work as an incentive for everyone to do their respective work and not to break the contract. Hopefully, we will not encounter this.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

We have as of now been introduced to the project, but we still don’t know about the specifications, other than that it should satisfy the terminal operators demands. As we have yet to be introduced to the terminal operators demands, we don’t have any success criteria. The way forward is to meet with the terminal operator and ask him for his specifications as well as the technical specifications required by the PortableCDM framework.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

We have been introduced to the project, although we haven’t started working with it yet. We have therefore not yet formulated any acceptance tests.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now we have been introduced to the project in a lecture explaining an overview of the problem and some information about what our purpose is. The fact that Easter is approaching and that we haven’t been introduced to our contact person made it difficult for us to start the process of planning the application. Our ambition for the week after the break is to meet our contact person and get familiar with the options we have. Until then we will dig into some of the litterature and read the scenario in the GitHub repository.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Kind of the same as the previous topic. At this moment we know a bit about what the application as a whole should be able to do. However we don’t know specifics concerning expected behaviour and demands. Our intentions are to map the suggested and wanted functions and pair these with the proper behaviour. To move forward with this we will study the subject and the scenario so that we are prepared to meet our contact person and get the most out of our first meeting.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is. We are supposed to meet with our “customers” the week after the easter break. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project. However, we are only meeting our “customers” the week after the easter break, which means that user stories for now seem to be quite a fruitless pursuit, since we don’t know our task or goal. Therefore, we will wait until our meeting with the customer, and hopefully after that things will become clearer in regards to this topic.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

We got introduced to the project this week but we still haven’t had the chance to get acquainted with the codebase we will be working with or the client we will be working for. We have been reading course literature though and have since identified two potential KPIs, one of which we can already start using. The first one is individual hours per week spent on the project and the other would be a burndown-chart of our backlog. The goal is to put in an average of 20 hours per week during the course period and keep the burndown-chart line as straight as possible, once we have established a backlog. For next week we want to have our third KPI ready and reach our goals with the other two (one for this week, since we haven’t started coding yet). The amount of hours spent is currently tracked in a shared excel file. We will find our third KPI by reading the literature, but we do think it will become much clearer when we know what we actually are going to do for this project.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Very similar to last week. We still haven’t started coding so we still don’t have any bugs to find. We have determined Findbugs to be a viable alternative though and will be using it once we start coding. Our goal is to have as few bugs as possible in the coming week, when the project actually starts. We will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Since last week we have talked about implementing and distributing different roles. The project has been introduced briefly and roles will help the working process and increase the working efficiency. Right after the easter break we will talk about the distribution of different roles.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Last week we got introduced to Scrum as a technique, which will be our main agile methodology. Some practices were mentioned in the lectures (XP etc.), and for the next coming weeks we would like to find out which of those practices that are appropriate to use.  

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Once again, we’ve dedicated around 15h to the course during this week. As the project is still in its starting tracks, it’s only logical that the full 20h recommendation is not fulfilled. When the actual development and implementation begins, more resources will likely be required to stay on schedule.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

This week, some working time has been spent attending the two lectures given in relation to the course - with the purpose of increasing the base knowledge for the project. In addition, the mechanics of how a harbour operates has been researched, as well as further work on understanding how to optimally utilize Scrum.
best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)

According to “Scrum and XP from the Trenches” a good way to manage the backlog is using a shared google sheets. Therefore we have created one in our drive that we can later start using, though until we have our first backlog refinement/sprint meeting we’re not really going to use it. Apart from that nothing has really changed from last week.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We still haven’t had any guest lectures or literature reviews so we can not reflect on them. However what we can do is the literature on the course-website ourselves to prepare ourselves for the guest lectures and that way be able discuss/reflect on the differences we find. Once we learn more about the project we will also start reflecting on how it relates to the literature we have read.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 3

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

Now: This week, connecting with last week’s goals, we developed user stories for the terminal, as the terminal is our client for this project. We used the Trello website in order to create these with a good overview and with easy access for everyone. Due to the fact that we haven’t met Mikael, our contact at terminal, we are not able to connect our own user stories with those of his specifications. For the prioritization, right now, we have made the prioritization following the order of the instructions made in the scenario on Github. Therefore, we will probably change the prioritization for each individual user story.
Goal: For next week, we want to meet up with Mikael and connect our user stories with his own perspectives of what is important in the development of the application. Here, we will gain useful insights for further development, and also beneficial perspectives to be used together with the scenario.
What to do: In order to complete our goal for next week, we will have a meeting with Mikael and come as prepared as we can, to ask relevant questions and to understand his specifications more fully. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Now: The social contract remains the same, as the one we created in the first week. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic, as stated in our contract. We have not yet encountered any difficulties regarding the group dynamics, as of now.  
Goal: We wish to add the individual roles of all the team members in the social contract. This we be useful to for each member in order to remember their respective roles and the responsibilities that comes with each role.
What to do: Just a simple update in our contract, with regard to the goal stated above.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: Our success criteria is to make the terminal worker satisfied with the app.
Goal: We want to adjust our success criteria to make it more specific.
What to do: Talk with the terminal worker and hear more specifically what it will take to make him satisfied with the app.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have no acceptance tests as of now.
Goal: Formulate an acceptance test for each user story.
What to do: Learn about the specific needs from the terminal worker. Edit our user stories to make them more specific so that we can properly formulate acceptance tests for each one of them.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: After reading some litterature we know some more about the scenario and what is expected. Thus we have written some user stories as far as our knowledge reaches. Unfortunately we did not get an answer from our contact person in time to organize a meeting.
Goal: As we haven’t yet had the opportunity to meet our contact person we hope to do that as soon as possible. Then we can double check our user stories and get a better picture of the project.
What to do: Set up a meeting with our contact person. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: We have set up a few user stories. Currently we are also setting up the development area to get things running.
Goal: The goal is to talk to our contact person and in collaboration state the functions of the app.
What to do: The next step is as above to get a meeting with our contact person.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is, other than the basic application demo and code we received last week. We were supposed to meet with our client the week after the easter break, but this will apparently be postponed until next week. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. However, we are only meeting our clients next week, which means that user stories for now seem to be quite a fruitless pursuit, since we don’t know our task or goal. Therefore, we will wait until our meeting with the client, and hopefully by that point things will become clearer in regards to this topic.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now: Since last week, we have refined our KPIs. The burndown-chart was scratched since it has been difficult to maintain one, without any user stories. Also, it would be too time consuming to keep one up to date in the later stages. The 3 current KPIs are:
Communication - Although not very measurable, it is critical to our success in our project. The ability to be clear and keep everyone up to date, both internally in the team and externally, will let everyone see the progress which is being made and the individual contributions. We have also just recently contacted the product owner (terminal 1) for the first time.
Estimation Accuracy - How accurate we are with our estimates of the user stories. This is critical since we have removed the burndown-chart. It also allows us to know exactly how much we can do each sprint and therefore also during the whole project. This metric is very useful, especially together with the next one.
Velocity Consistency - Making sure we work 20 hours every week was replaced by this metric (mostly just a fancy name for the same thing). This metric, together with the previous, will once again allow us to be able to tell the product owner how much we can accomplish during every week and also the whole project.
Goal: The communication inside of the team has been alright so the focus in on good communication with the product owner. For the other two metrics, it is difficult to tell since we haven’t had the chance to actually use the user stories we created yet. Judging on how deceptively long time it took to get the environment up and running it will be difficult to get correct estimates.
What to do: Book our first meeting with the product owner and establish a good communication channel. Start working on the user stories next week and see how well we are estimating the times. Also make sure to aim for 20 hour per week.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Now: Still haven’t written any lines of code, although we thought we would by this time in last weeks reflection.
Goal: Write good code.
What to do: Same as we wrote last week, we will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding, but also through checking each other's code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: As of now, we started to contribute some roles within the team. Gabriel was assigned the role of Scrummaster and Emil was decided to be the contact person of the group.
Goal: To assign more clear roles within the near future to aid our working process. 
What to do: As we get further into the project new roles will appear and our goal is to distribute them in a fair and proper way.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: The current main agile practice that is being used is still Scrum and will be throughout the project. Scrum is the framework we use to implement agile development. This week we set up a board on Trello to be able to apply Scrum.
Goal: Learn more about Scrum and improve our board on Trello. XP is something that was mentioned as an agile practice, maybe there is a way to implement it later.
What to do: Read articles to improve our knowledge about agile development and Scrum. Try to find out if any more agile practices can be implemented into our project. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: We’ve kept on schedule and dedicated approximately the planned 20h per person and week. 
Goal: To continue working along the same lines as we currently are in the following weeks, maintaining the scheduled level of work. 
What to do: Stick to the schedule in order to avoid pushing work ahead.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: The preliminary user stories have been successfully set up through Trello, but will be refined after the meeting with the product owner. In addition, the first attempts to use the programming software have been made - although so far, there have been problems with getting it to function properly. 
Goal: Next week will be the first proper sprint, so the goal is to finish all user stories for that week, and later do another review of the week. So getting a more complete understanding of the problems and getting to work on the programming.
What to do: Meet up with the client. Understand how to properly use the development toolkit. 

**Test practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Trello
Now: We have set up a Trello team where we have a created board with our Product Backlog, in other words we have decided not to use google sheet for the product backlog like we said two weeks ago. 
Goal: We also plan on creating a board for each sprint in the future. Trello will be the main tool in which our team remains coordinated and follows the scrum framework. Some of our internal communication will also be held in Trello though will also keep using our Facebook Messenger group.
What to do: The trello features we haven’t used yet that will help us reach our goals are:
Checklists in each user story with criterias (such as the ones in our definition of done) that we use to know when we can move the user story to the next column in the sprint board.
Assigning members to each user story and task so we know who is working on what.
Comments and mentioning members so we can communicate efficiently instead of always using the fb messaging group in order to avoid it getting too cluttered.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

Guest lectures
Now: During the last guest lecture on Monday we discussed the difference between user stories, tasks and epics, how a sprint board should work, how to manage a product backlog and most importantly how to slice user stories. Most of what was discussed we had already read in the literature and only had to make small adjustments to our scrum but the content regarding how to slice stories was very educational and will be useful for our project in the future.
Goal: Stories should be vertically sliced in way that they are of independent value to the product owner and follow the INVEST criterias while tasks should follow the SMART Criterias.
What to do: Will read a bit more about the INVEST and SMART criterias to make sure we have them in mind when slicing stories.
Also want to note that unfortunately none of us could attend Wednesday exercise in Lindholmen so we can’t comment on that.


# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 4

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 4

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

Now: This week, we unfortunately have not met up with Mikael as he got impediments. However, we have still developed these together with the product owners and they are now more in line with their scope. The prioritization remains the same, as we will ask about this on our appointment with Mikael and what his prioritization is. Therefore, our scope and user stories are subjects to change and it will be interesting to see where they will end up after our meeting with Mikael next week. 

Goal: This goal remains the same as last week, due to Mikael not being able to meet and postponing our meeting. For next week, we want to meet up with Mikael and connect our user stories with his own perspectives of what is important in the development of the application. Here, we will gain useful insights for further development, and also beneficial perspectives to be used together with the scenario. Furthermore, we want to prioritize our user stories and start to work with them in the application. 

What to do: In order to complete our goal for next week, we will have a meeting with Mikael and come as prepared as we can, to ask relevant questions and to understand his specifications more fully. Also, we will talk more with our product owners during the supervision to be in line with them and take their insights in consideration together with Mikael’s specifications and needs. Furthermore, we will try to start coding a bit and have something to show the product owners in order to get appropriate response on our work.

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Now: This week we have added the individual roles in the social contract, so that everyone can remember their respective roles and the responsibilities that come with them. 

Goal: Next week, we want to add the different parts of the application that each member is responsible of and that will help everyone remember what they are supposed to produce and without misunderstanding between members of the team. It will provide clarity and help us keep track of what we want to produce individually. Also, it will be beneficial in knowing whom to contact if one comes across a certain problem. 

What to do: Just a simple update in our contract, with regard to the goal stated above.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: Our success criteria is to make the terminal worker satisfied with the app. So our success criteria is unchanged since last week.
Goal: We want to adjust our success criteria to make it more specific. Hopefully we can do this as we understand more about our customer and his needs.
What to do: Talk with the terminal worker and hear more specifically what it will take to make him satisfied with the app. Learn about what features he needs and doesn’t need.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have no acceptance tests as of now.
Goal: Formulate an acceptance test for each user story.
What to do: Learn about the specific needs from the terminal worker. Edit our user stories to make them more specific so that we can properly formulate acceptance tests for each one of them.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: We’ve given the user stories a first approach and started a dialog with both the project owners and our contact person.
Goal: Our goal is to further specify the design of the application. We want to understand the scenario better as well.
What to do: Next week we will have a meeting with our contact person at the terminal. Then we will discuss what direction the application will take.


**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: Some people in the group have been able to get the application running, which is a huge leap forward. We have started a discussion about what parts in the application we want to focus on.
Goal: Next week we are meeting our contact person. In collaboration with him and the project owners we hope to specify how the application should operate.
What to do: Have a meeting in the group about thoughts to bring to the contact person as well as discussing these thoughts with him.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

Now: At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is, other than the basic application demo and code we have installed since last week. We were supposed to meet with our client the week after the easter break, but this meeting will occur next week instead. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

Goal: Meet with client.

What to do: Meet with client, then create structural overview of application.


**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

Now: At this stage we have installed the default project app in Android studio, but we have not yet met our client. We still need to meet our client for a better picture, but so far, we have created initial user stories after consulting the product owners and gone through the scenarios thoroughly.

Goal: Meet with client, finalize initial user stories.

What to do: Meet with client, update user stories.


**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now: 
Communication - Still haven’t had the chance to meet the contact person from the terminal and establish a communication channel. The internal communication has been going well. Didn’t mention it last time but it is through Facebook’s messenger mostly. Another part added this week will be communication with our product owners, in the shape of weekly meetings during the “handledning”.
Estimation Accuracy - It was very hard to estimate how much time getting everyone up to speed with the development environment would take. Hopefully this will be better next week.
Velocity Consistency - Most of the group worked for about 20 hours this week, or a little bit less, most of this time was spent on getting the environment ready to go and better understanding the viewpoint of the terminal worker through the scenario.
Goal: Have good communication with the product-owners and “customer”. Make the estimates of our user stories as close to reality as possible on monday and put in about 20 hours of work per person for the week.
What to do: Pretty much same as last week, will be interesting to see how well we can communicate with the customer, so far e-mail communication has been slow but working alright, maybe we need to change the channel for next week? We need to distribute the user stories so that every team member will get about 20 hours of work in total for the week. Also take into account that we were way off in estimating how long setting up the environment would take.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Now: Exactly the same as last week, still haven’t written any lines of code, although we thought we would by this time in last weeks reflection.
Goal: Write good code.
What to do: Same as we wrote last week, we will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding, but also through checking each other's code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: Gabriel is still our team’s Scrummaster and is attending some valuable meetings with Scrummasters from other project groups. Emil is our contact person. Since the coding process is about to start the rest of the group is within the developer team as of now.

Goal: Specify even more roles if possible, and if needed switch roles within the team. Build on our developer team.

What to do: Work closely together to determine new roles if needed.  

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: After setting up a board on Trello last week we’ve really started to implement Scrum as an agile practice. Scrum will still be our main agile practice and framework. After next week when we can start our coding process it will be very useful. 

Goal: Develop our user stories and Trello-board, to have efficiency in our sprints and enable agile development. XP is something that was mentioned as an agile practice, maybe there is a way to implement it later.

What to do: Keep improving our Scrum knowledge and use it as an agile practice to benefit our development. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: As before, we have worked approximately 20 hours each on the project. Most of the time has been spent in setting up the programming environment for each member, as it was a lot of problems to handle in setting that up. Additionally, we (not everyone, but the majority) have been attending both the lecture and the supervision. On top of this, we have been spending time further developing our user stories and explored the code together with the application. 

Goal: To continue working along the same lines as we currently are in the following weeks, maintaining the scheduled level of work. Emphasis next week will probably be on coding, together with the appointment with Mikael and attending the lecture and supervision. 

What to do: Stick to the schedule in order to avoid pushing work ahead and also keep filling out our Excel sheet to keep track of our hours, in order to give a sufficient review of next week when speaking of how we have spent our hours and with what. 

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: Our preliminary user stories were reviewed together with the product owner on wednesday and refined throughout the week afterwards. They will be further refined after the meeting with the customer on monday. We have a working programming environment for most of the group, but this was not shown to the product owner.
Goal: Next week the goal is to be able to able to show some coding progress to the product owners on wednesday, and potentially to the customer, whenever a new date for a second meeting will be set. Another goal is to make better use of scrum next week, by meeting on monday and setting up even better user stories.
What to do: To do this we will further refine our user stories to be more thinly sliced and vertical on monday after our meeting. This will allow us to have some working demo on wednesday, hopefully.

**Test practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: Since we haven’t actually started coding yet there hasn’t been any need for an IDE or version control system, although it is something that we will talk about and try to set up soon so that it isn’t an issue when we actually start. No changes to our scrum board either
Goal: Our goal is to have an IDE and a version control system that everyone understands and know how to use so that we can work efficiently.
What to do: We need to sit together and discuss how to set these up.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

Now: We have not had any guest lectures this week so there we can’t talk about it. However we have read some of the Marine IT litterature posted on github.

Goal: We want to know more about the harbor, not just about Terminal 1 works. This help us get a bigger overview and be able to see opportunities where we can collaborate with other teams.

What to do: Read all of the Marine IT litterature.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 5

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**
Now: As we now have met Mikael and his co-workers, we have gotten useful insights in how the terminal operates and what kind of information and features they would like to see be displayed in the application. Unfortunately, they are not using the application as of now and their knowledge about the app was scarce. However, they still provided us with useful as stated above. 

Together with this we have made a priority list as follows: Change the Portcall view to show vessels sorted by ETA, change the berth view to give an overview of what is happening in different berths without having to click on each one separately, calculate ETB, ETC, ETD and mediate these to other parties, would like to see what type of cargo and volume so the estimation of ETC can be more accurate and readily available upon berthing (talk to ship agent or vessel).
To whom we are creating value are: Product owner, terminal, also all other parties (at this time we think that the ship agent will be the actor with most use of our information).

Goal: For next week, we want to continue developing the priority and features for the application. We will do this in cooperation with mainly the product owners, and also the terminal workers. 

What to do: In order to cooperate with the product owners, we need to be able to meet them and have them look at our user stories and the current prioritization that we have. Unfortunately the product owners left before we could show them the user stories (they left early and didn’t see us) though so we will send them by email to get feedback. However we did not want to wait with our sprint to get feedback from them so we decided to start in the meantime and if necessary we can make some tweaks during the sprint depending on what they anwer.

**Your social contract**

Now: This week, our group moved our reflection day to wednesday, due to the fact that our regular meetings will be held on mondays and wednesdays. Our group dynamics are good.

Goal: Keep up the social contract and if any problems occur dynamically within the group, these will be of interest to bring up in the contract.

What to do: Work together and as stated above, if any problems occur, these will reflect in the contract.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: We have discussed the success criteria that define our application. We agreed upon the following success criteria:
To make the terminal, product owner and course administrator satisfied
Achieved all user stories in the application
Provide other actors with value, for instance relevant data from the terminal in an easily accessible way

Goal: Work towards these criteria, update them when needed and also try to get response on them from our supervisor and/or product owner.

What to do: Keep working and also get in touch with product owner/supervisor to get their view of the success criteria. 


**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have created a checklist as a definition of done in Trello for each user story, which defines the definition of done. These are shown below:
It can handle all variations/combinations of input data that it should
The code is clean
The code has comments explaining the code
The product owner approves
On top of that each user story has another checklist called acceptance criterias that describes the things that have to be fulfilled for a user story to be ready for testing and set as done if the tester, who is another person, checks all the boxes in the acceptance criterias as well as definition of done. We showed Håkan our checklists and he said they said they looked good, we only had to do some small adjustments.

Goal: Work towards these definitions of done, and improve the definitions if necessary in the future.

What to do: We will talk about the acceptance tests next wednesday after the sprint review and change them if we feel it’s necessary

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: We have some initial thoughts of how the design should be made. Below is our initial thoughts of what APIs to use and which architecture pattern to use.
API: One example is to make an API so other parties can interact with the data from the terminal
Architecture patterns: Model-View-Controller, further development will be using the model-view-controller pattern. We will ask Håkan if this is possible or if there are other patterns more suitable for the application and the already existing code.
Goal: Our goal is to be able to have a more substantial design, but this will come from us continuing to code and develop our own part of the application.

What to do: As we have said above, the design of the application will become clearer as the coding progresses. Therefore, it is essential for us to continue with the code and get response from Håkan and the others. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: We have made a more theoretical approach to the overview of our application, as the coding part of the project has just started. However, as stated above, we have made a theoretical approach of this and can be read below. 
Examples through screenshots of the application
We want to modify the port call window so that the berths are clear and it shows future ETA’s
We want to modify the vessel window so that you can see the cargo type and volume and click on it to edit/calculate ETC
Goal: Our goal is to be able to have more substantial overviews in forms of screenshots for example. This will derive naturally from the fact that the application will be further developed and as we progress the more screenshots we will be able to upload and show. 

What to do: This connects to what is stated above, as we continue to code and develop the application - the more we will be able to show here. 

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**
Now: As we have not yet any substantial breakthroughs when it comes to coding, we have not yet any structural overview of the application to show.

Goal: Hopefully next week, when we have coded more, we will be able to show a rough scheme of our overview and how we are thinking about the structure.

What to do: By continuing to code, the goal above will come naturally from the fact that the development of the application will provide us with class diagrams etc. 

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

Now: 
We have developed our user stories together with the terminal and are waiting for our next response from our product owners
Acceptance criteria and definition of done: Done, read above
Task breakdown: We are doing these for each user story to be developed in each sprint
Effort estimation: We have done these for each user story. The definition of effort estimation is hours, thus one hour is equal to one hour of effective work. The maximum capacity each week is 20 hours per member. Thus we have 6*20 hours of time to spend each week in total. 

Goal: As our focus will move from the development of these user stories, our goal is to maintain them and develop them further if it is found necessary to do so. 

What to do: As stated above, due to our focus being moved from here to the coding part, we will maintain these and if we are inclined to change or modify our user stories - we will do so. 


**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**
Now:
Communication: We have now met with the terminal workers and we have established our relation with them. Further communication will be mostly through emails with them. For instance, they have given us useful velocities when it comes to loading and unloading of oil. Furthermore, we have also established two separate communication channels within the team. The first one is on Messenger and here we will have a more informal communication with each other. The other is multiple Slack channels for everything formal related to the project. For instance, problems with code, design of the application and so on. 
Estimation Accuracy: We have set up the estimates for each user story and these will be reflected on here, when each user story has been finished according to our definition of done. 
Velocity Consistency: Referring to our velocity this week, each and everyone has spent about 20 hours on the project. 

Goal: We want to continue with our great communication, both within the group and with everyone else outside of the group. After our meeting, our client has been answering much quicker. Also, we will be strict in using our two channels, with Slack being the more formal and Messenger being the more informal. Our estimation accuracy will be interesting to see next week, when we hopefully have fulfilled a few of the user stories. Therefore, they will be subject of reflection next week and connect them with our velocity consistency.

What to do: We will continue working with the coding part and have our three KPIs in mind. 

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs**

Now: As we just have started coding, we have no use of Findbugs just yet.

Goal: Have code available for checking next week.

How to get there: Start working more on the code. 

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: The roles remain the same as previously.

Goal: Continue working with roles that support the project in the optimal way and if the roles are subject to change, this will be done in order to keep the momentum and keep our individual responsibilities.

How to get there: Keep working the same way as long as it provides efficient results. Make changes further ahead if found to be necessary.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: We have done general time estimates for each user story, in order to get a better understanding of how to design the coding process and get a better overview of the project from a time perspective. Additionally, we’ve set up a Slack channel to further improve and optimize the team’s communication and decrease clutter (lot of scrolling in Messenger). On Monday we will have a “daily scrum” to discuss how our sprint is going so far. We have 4 user stories during this sprint with two team members working on each.

Goal: We didn’t have time to write tasks for the user stories together so each pair will do task breakdowns themselves, and time estimates on each task once the task breakdown is complete. This will provide more accuracy regarding the stories.

How to get there: The team members involved in a user story may divide the tasks between them themselves. We will try to look at the scrum board during the week and remind each other to do things as planned.


**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: Initially we had a preparation meeting through Skype on Sunday, discussing the scenario and making a plan ahead of the meeting with the terminal workers. This meeting then took place on Monday, and lasted around two hours. Afterward, we spent three hours in the afternoon setting up Android Studio, as well as updating some of the user stories. Finally, all of Wednesday was spent working on the GitHub repo for the group members, writing the group reflections, drawing a demo for the product owners, starting with a small amount of coding, as well as continuing with the user stories from Monday. 

Goal: Spending 20 hours per week and person working on the project. 

How to get there: With most of the preparation finally set up, most of the work from this point onward will be spent on the actual coding.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: Today our first real sprint is starting and we have divided 4 user stories between us so it will be interesting for us to see how it goes for us. On wednesday morning we will have a sprint review. 

Goal: Because this is our first sprint it is really difficult to estimate how long user stories take and what our velocity is. So even if we fail to deliver all four user stories our main goal is to get familiar with coding and get better at estimating story points and velocity.

How to get there: while developing we should write down how long time everything actually took so we know for next time.

**Test practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: Listed all the questions we’d like to ask during Wednesday’s counselling. Color-coded the user stories in the backlog to be able to efficiently track relations in between them, providing an easily understood overview. Developed a repo that can be used with GitIgnores. Instead of having one board for each sprint and another board for the product backlog we now have everything in a single trello board. This will help us get a better view of everything that is happening and minimize the risk of a user story getting forgotten.

Goal: Easy understanding of which tasks belong to which user story by using numbers in front of each card. Get the new repo to work on everyone’s computer

How to get there: Color-coding also the tasks in the sprint board. 

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**
We haven’t had time to read more literature due to other things being prioritized. There have also not been any guest lectures.
