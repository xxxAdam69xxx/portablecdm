What do I want to learn or understand better?
As scrum is a new approach to working on projects for us, the main focus during the early
phase of the course will be to familiarize ourselves with what it entails. At this stage, it’s
difficult to specify any other goals, as this week has been mostly about introduction to the
subject at hand. Once actual work has been started on the actual task, specifying clear weekly
learning goals will become easier.

 How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As mentioned above, work at this point consists mostly of familiarizing oneself with the
scrum approach. The group will work together in ensuring that each member develops a
reasonable level of understanding, thus enabling everyone to contribute to the finished
product.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Once I’ve become more familiar with the details, I’ll be able to answer this more
appropriately. For now, it’s as mentioned all about developing a stable base of understanding.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Ensuring that I fulfil my end of the social contract put forth by the group, by going through
this week’s slides and participating in the building game – thus bringing me up to speed on
the ideas presented.

What do I want to learn or understand better?
With the project introduced, I’m mostly focused on understanding the logistics and mechanics of how a harbour operates. Being well-informed on how the problem situation works is key in developing an application that actually causes improvement to the system.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The whole group is more or less working on the same thing – knowledge building – at the moment. Therefore, cooperation is mostly about ensuring everyone is on the same page and caught up with the status of the project. My part in this will be the same as everyone else’s – helping out if anyone is having trouble grasping parts of the discussion.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As with last week, it’s difficult to concretely specify this part just yet, as the project up until this point has been all about studying literature to grasp the project as a whole. This question will come more into play as the project is split up into separate tasks.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I believe I’ve lived up to my promise from last week by studying scrum to better understand the mechanics of it. Until next report, it’s all about continuing to study as much as possible, regarding the problem situation and harbour logistics.

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I’d like to clearly define my role in the team with regards to the roles set up during this
week’s sprint. Also, once we’ve met up with the client, the problem situation should finally
become clear and we can begin really attacking the issue. Start familiarizing with the code
app.

 How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As with last week, the whole group has mostly been working together on the same issue – this
time getting the programming software to function. With the newly established roles, we
should finally be able to start working more individually on different sections of the problem.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Once again, the individual contribution is difficult to quantify as the group has been working
together as one unit. Ensuring that the software starts working is of the highest priority as of
right now.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I’ve probably been a bit less active than some of the other team members this week, as I left
for a vacation towards the end of the week. Before then, I was part of the group’s effort to
move the project forward. Since I’ll be away for most of next week, my productivity will be
put on hold for now, but I will make sure to return with full focus once I’m back from my


Weekly reflection 4

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I’ve spent the whole week on vacation, away from Gothenburg, my computer, and the project.
As a result, I haven’t made any progress in my knowledge of the course area this week.

 How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By the same logic as above, I obviously haven’t been able to help out with this during the
week. I’ve been available for messages, but that’s about it.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
No work done, so obviously no contribution toward the scrum application either.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Nothing really, for obvious reasons. Next week I will be back and focusing whole-heartedly
on being as helpful as possible in the team’s efforts to continue the project.

Weekly reflection 5

•	What do I want to learn or understand better?
As I spent all of last week away, I’m going to start by catching up with what was done by the rest of the group during my absence, in order to get myself up to date with everything. Once I’m finished with that, I want to dive into the section of the problem that I will be part of writing the code for.   

•	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By working together in getting to work on the actual coding. The set-up has been quite problematic so far, so we have just about managed to get everything working this week. I will also work together with my coding partner to ensure that we manage to solve the part of the problem that we have been assigned to. 

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As mentioned above, we have now split the problem into smaller parts by dividing up the different user stories among pairs of group members. Each of us will attempt to have our user story finished next week, and then prepare for the new sprint.

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was part of the long discussion meeting we had, setting up the last bit of software for all group members as well as deciding the coding pairs and assigning user stories to these.  Together with my partner, I will work on our assigned user story and try to have everything ready for next week’s group meeting, where every pair can reflect over whether the assigned task was of reasonable scope, too small or too large. 

Weekly reflection 6
•	What do I want to learn or understand better?
During this week’s attempts to start writing code, I realized the difficulty of taking over working code that’s written by someone else – especially since JavaScript, a protocol I’m not familiar with, is involved. Together with my coding partner, I quickly realized that trying to make changes in a program that’s already working is quite different from developing your own application from scratch. Also, simply understanding how to use the programming software has proven quite a challenging task so far. However, thanks to advice from a supervisor, I believe I’ve finally understood and feel ready to continue working on the code next week.

•	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The fact that you don’t have to rebuild the emulator every time you open Android Studio, but rather just have to re-run the process through AVD Manager is my main lesson from this week. This will allow much more efficient progress to be made in the future, and I will be sure to mention this to the group members that weren’t present for the supervision. 

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
During the coding process, we realized that the user story that Alexander and I are responsible for was larger and more complex than initially anticipated. Therefore, we have split it into a set of smaller sub-tasks, in order to more accurately match the content of the sprint to the amount of time available during a working week.  

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Alexander and I spent most of Monday working on the code, specifically attempting to add functionality that allows the notifying a vessel of its designated terminal. This was found to be difficult, and only a small bit of progress has been made (in the shape of adding a button to the Vessel Info view), but hopefully next week we should be able to understand the code a bit better and start working on its actual functionality.

Weekly reflection 7
•	What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now: The user story that Alexander and I were working on turned out to be redundant after talking to the shipping agents, so we’re looking into a new task now.

Goal: Understand the new task assigned to us and implement it in an efficient way.

How to get there: Start working on the implementation of the new user story. 

•	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: Alexander and I will work together to figure out how to implement a new view into the application, and how to design that view optimally.

Goal: Having learned how to implement and design a new view. 

How to get there: Working together through trial-and-error to understand what we’re writing. 

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: I’m still working with Alexander as part of a coding pair, utilizing that as an agile practice. As mentioned, the user story we were working on turned out to be unnecessary, and we’ve realized that some of our user stories are dependent on each other. 

Goal: Having more manageable and smaller tasks to choose from for the next sprint, and having checked that each of these are actually necessary for the implementation of the application.

How to get there: Continue working in my coding pair, now focusing on a smaller task that should be more reasonable to finish in one sprint. 

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Now: Due to main focus being on finishing the bachelor thesis this week, I haven’t been able to spend as much time as I would’ve liked this week. However, since our assigned user story turned out to be redundant, this actually wasn’t a complete disaster.

Goal: Finish the new task, having a view designed to calculate cargo operation times for fuelling. 

How to get there: Spend some extra hours working on the project to make up for this week’s shortage.

Weekly reflection 8
•	What do I want to learn or understand better?
Alexander and I have managed to implement a new view, intended for calculating cargo time, as well as adding some very basic calculator functionality. This has been the first task of the new user story we adopted last week, meaning are now in the process of improving the design of the view in order to be more easy to use. This means studying other sections of the code, looking for design ideas that can be used for our view.   

•	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Working together in our pair to find a user-friendly way to design the view, also keeping in mind the limited time frame remaining with the final presentation coming next week. 

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As mentioned in previous questions, we’re still using programming pairs as an agile practice. This is believed to be working quite well, as it takes some pressure away when each person has a partner to rely on and discuss with while working. At the same time, we’re also able to split the project up into several sections, due to the fact that we have several pairs working simultaneously. Finally, we’ve been dividing the user stories into smaller and smaller tasks, in order to have many smaller milestones to work towards, and also making the project scope a bit easier to grasp.

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Co-implementing the new calculator view, along with functionality, together with Alexander. During Wednesday’s supervision session, I also took rather large responsibility for compiling the week’s group reflection, allowing some of the other group members to focus more intensely on developing the code further. 

Final weekly reflection

•	What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now: I would say most of my insights from this project relate to dealing with frustration and lack of progress as a group. As also discussed in the final team reflection, several weeks in the earlier stages of the course passed without seemingly any significant ground being broken despite our best efforts. Time after time, software issues seemed to stop us in our tracks, casting major doubt over whether we’d actually be able to present some actual development at the end. Due to this, I’m quite proud we managed to push through and eventually reach successful implementation of some user stories.

What to do better in future projects: Mainly, the ratio between time spent on preparation and time spent actually developing the application needs to change drastically. If we’d have started actually producing code earlier in the process – as initially intended – I believe more functionality could’ve been added and testing could’ve been performed more rigorously. 

How to bridge the gap: An easy fix would be choosing projects relying on software that you have installed and languages you’re familiar with, dramatically shortening the take-off distance for the project. In cases where this is not an option, make sure you are able to familiarize yourself with everything early on and have help available if problems arise. 

•	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: I believe most of our ideas and breakthroughs have been brought forth through group discussions. Therefore, I find it difficult to point to specific instances of me personally breaking new ground, as opposed to just being an active part of the discussions. Additionally, the pair programming has been a good example of two parties working together to solve problems more efficiently than would’ve been possible by working alone.   

What to do better in future projects: As mentioned above, I think we’ve been working together really well as a group, and I believe a large part of that is owed to the fact that we were all good friends beforehand and therefore very comfortable working openly and sharing ideas together. What might’ve been useful however, is perhaps having high level programming knowledge available from more members within the group. 

How to bridge the gap: Forming a team where people feel comfortable working together really helps with building trust, as it’s easier for people to ask questions and get assistance from other members without feeling stupid. Balance differing knowledge within the group for instance by doing pair programming and mixing more and less knowledgeable people. 

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: I’ve had a rather difficult time adjusting to this method of structuring a course, as I generally tend to work better by collecting tasks throughout and working through all of them efficiently near the end – you could say I need a nearby deadline closing in to really tap into my full potential. With that said, I’ve done my best to cope with scrum by taking part in the weekly meetings and discussing how to change our user stories continuously – more specifically in realizing that our early estimates were quite optimistic.  
What to do better in future projects: As previously mentioned, we’ve come to terms with the fact that it’s easy to underestimate the amount of time required to implement a user story. If tasked with doing this again, I’d be much more realistic regarding the amount of work possible to complete within the time frame of a single sprint. 

How to bridge the gap: Split user stories up into many smaller tasks that are very basic by themselves. This provides many steps to check off along the way, which adds to the feeling that progress is being made. Keep dividing the work among programming pairs within the group, to allow for multiple user stories to be worked on simultaneously.  

•	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Now: In general, I would say I’ve probably spent slightly less time working on the course than some other members of my group. This stems mainly from the fact that I was on vacation for a couple of weeks in the early stages – something that was already booked before I knew the course would have so many responsibilities each and every week already from the start. Nevertheless, I tried to be as accessible as possible even then, and did manage to put together individual reflections also for those weeks.

Since returning, however, I’ve tried to make up for missed time by always being present and putting in the hours required to move the development forward. As my programming knowledge has been rather limited in comparison to, for instance, Konrad’s, I’ve tried to focus a lot of my efforts on the weekly group reflections. In addition, I think Alexander and I have made a tremendous programming pair, eventually managing to implement the new Calculator View. While I would argue he is definitely the more skilled programming of us, I think we balanced the work between us rather evenly, discussing ideas and overcoming a rather annoying number of code bugs.

What to do better in future projects: I’d obviously like to be involved with the project throughout the entirety of the process – dedicating as much time and effort as everyone else. Moreover, while I don’t see myself pursuing a career within IT in the future, I’d like to improve my knowledge of programming in the case that I would come into contact with the industry. 

How to bridge the gap: Be physically present for the whole project time span. Study to improve my programming skills in the event of another IT-related course. Speaking of this, I would’ve liked to see a more proper introduction to the software and languages used at the start of the course, as these were new to practically everyone and a lot of aspects were very unclear from the start. With a more solid base to stand on, I believe the project would’ve been more successful.
