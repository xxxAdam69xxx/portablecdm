Weekly reflection - Alexander, week 4


What do I want to learn or understand better?

At the moment, I would like to learn and understand the project better. I have basically only played around with the app we were given to install on our computers. I basically know that our project has to do with the effectivisation of communication between stakeholders in the marine transport business, but thats nothing new since last week. We will improve an app in regards to a specific stakeholder that we were given, also old information. We have not met the stakeholder, but at least our group has made user stories, which made the project a little bit clearer for me. I hope that after the meeting with the client, and playing around with the source code of the original application togeher with the group, as well as setting up common goals and decomposing source code with the group, that things will become clearer.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

At this point now much is known about what we should aim towards with the project. Therefore there is not much more to do other than dig into the course literature and hopefully gain a better understanding of marine transport as well as scrum, git, and vision. This has not changed since last week. However, I was one of the first in my group to install the app successfully, so I have helped my other groupmates install the app on their computers.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

This week there wasn’t much new work other than creating user stories. I contributed to my teams scrumming by writing a part of the team reflection, as well as reflecting on the project introduction with my team after the course, just like last week.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

At this point we have no specific delivery goals set out. Hopefully next week we will have them, after we speak with our customer. Hopefully we will speak to the customer next week.

Week 5:


What do I want to learn or understand better?

At the moment, I would like to learn how to understand the app better. Our group set programming deadlines for our weekly sprint, which means that it is time to learn the code and get dirty!

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

At this point I can help my sprint teammate with the coding of our task. If we work together, there will be a mutual aid and exchange of knowledge in order to achieve the acceptance criteria of the task and reach the definitions of done in the best manner possible.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

My contribution this week was writing a larger portion of the group reflection, and helping to try and figure out, define, and elaborate user stories, so that they have definitions of done and acceptance criteria. I have also been assigned as the programming master, which I will be doing next week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

My contribution as stated above, is attending group meetings, discussing user stories, acceptance criteria, and definitions of done.

Week 6:


What do I want to learn or understand better?

At the moment, I would like to learn how to understand the code of the app better. For this weeks sprint Adam and I were given the task to make it possible for terminal workers to assign a terminal to incoming ships via the app. However, the app has no feature names terminal, only port. The documentation given mentions nothing about terminals, and so far I have not been able to find any server API of some sort. At the moment I feel like I have to find some way to make the server create a new attribute to vessels and store it, however I have no idea how to do so.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

At this point I have helped my teammate understand the general area of where to code our interface, and how. My knowledge in html and java can be of use, since I can explain to my team how and where the front end interface system can be coded. However, I lack the knowledge required to send and receive data, i.e. make the interface interactive.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

My contribution to the teams application of scrum is basically the structuring of things to do for the user story assigned to me, and fulfilling one part of this (front end interface draft). I also contributed by realising that this scrum week had too hard of an assignment to be able to do it in one week. This is a contribution towards the weeks scrum reflections.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
 
My contribution this week was learning how the interface layout is structured in the app. I also created a interface draft, or MVP, of how the interface for our user story should look like.
