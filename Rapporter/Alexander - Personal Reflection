Weekly reflection - Alexander

What do I want to learn or understand better?
At the moment, I would like to learn and understand the project better. We were given an introduction to it, so I basically know that our project has to do with the effectivisation of communication between stakeholders in the marine transport business. We will improve an app in regards to a specific stakeholder that we were given. However, we have not met the stakeholder, so our entire project goal is so far unclear.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point now much is known about what we should aim towards with the project. Therefore there is not much more to do other than dig into the course literature and hopefully gain a better understanding of marine transport as well as scrum, git, and vision.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
This week there wasn’t much new work other than learning about the project. I contributed to my teams scrumming by writing a part of the team reflection, as well as reflecting on the project introduction with my team after the course.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
At this point we have no specific delivery goals set out. Hopefully next week we will have them, after we speak with our customer.
